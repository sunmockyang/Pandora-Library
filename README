######################## Purpose of program ########################
The pandora library system was made to keep track of books and patrons who are borrowing the books. The patron must sign in, and they will be able to checkout available books, and check in books that they've already checkd out. An admin can add/remove patrons from the system, and any user is able to view all books in the library.

This program was ported over from a C version, for assignment 1 of the COMP2404 Intro to Systems Engineering class.
